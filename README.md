# GMIA_rGMIA
Gaussian Markov Improvement Algorithm and Rapid Gaussian Markov Improvement Algorithm

## About the Solver

Two solvers that use Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs) as metamodels for the response surface. Selections of solutions to simulate is based on the complete expected improvement (CEI) criterion.

## Properties

**Variable Class**: Integer-ordered.

**Constraints Class**: Box constraints.
